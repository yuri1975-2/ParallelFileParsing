NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

Program retrieving in command line parameters:
1) directory with files to be parsed. The white characters are assumed as items delimiter;
2) file where results of parsing should be placed;
3) number of threads of file parsing. This number shouldn't noticably exceeds number of logical processor cores.
